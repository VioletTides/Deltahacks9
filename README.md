## The Problem
40% of all food in America is wasted
Still, the increasing cost of living means food banks are anticipating a 60% increase in demand, and wealth disparity is still increasing.
Higher income areas end up with more food, while lower incomes are running out


## What it does
Allows food banks to create unique users using Firebase Auth and keep track of current inventory with realtime database. Integrates Leaflet for latitude and longitude data input when the food bank makes their account. Food banks can input the UIDs of other food banks and create an export order, routing via the fastest path with Leaflet router.

## Future Plans
Combining economic in combination with stock in a weighted shortest path algorithm, so that food banks in low income area will have more stock.
Making it possible to add multiple food banks in one export form, implementing Dijkstra's algorithm with Leaflet to optimize fuel consumption and travel time.
